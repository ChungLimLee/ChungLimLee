# 👋 Hi, I'm Chung Lim Lee

I'm a self-taught developer who builds technically deep, performance-focused JavaScript applications.  
I care about how things actually work — from memory efficiency to input latency to browser quirks — and I build from scratch when existing tools don’t cut it.

## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 🎮 [SO Othello – Unlimited Endgame Puzzle](https://github.com/ChungLimLee/soOthello)
A fully interactive Othello app in JS with unlimited endgame puzzles, study mode, puzzle sharing via link, and perfect-play solving.

- Generates **solvable endgame puzzles** from any board with 12 or more empty squares.
- Currently published version uses a clean and efficient **1D-array board representation**.
- Internally 100% tested versions include:
  - A **Bitboard** implementation for compact binary operations (up to 10x faster than 1D-array).
  - A novel, self-developed **SO-board** format that **outperforms** bitboards in certain metrics and has the potential to be faster overall.
- Allows **puzzle sharing via link** to LinkedIn, X (Twitter), WhatsApp, and Facebook — so users can easily share, discuss, and revisit specific puzzle states.
- Supports **undo/redo**, win/draw/loss outcome classification, and best-move exploration.
- Self-published and accepted by [https://worldothello.org.](https://www.worldothello.org/news/435/open-book-of-othello)

> ⚙️ Not just a game — a tool for strategy study and perfect-play exploration.

### 🗄️ [soStorage.js – LocalStorage-Like API Using IndexedDB](https://github.com/ChungLimLee/soStorage.js)
A tiny, zero-dependency JavaScript library that provides a **localStorage-like API**, backed by **IndexedDB** for modern browser storage.

- Use it just like `localStorage`, but with full support for:
  - **Structured data types** (objects, arrays, numbers, etc.)
  - **Larger data sizes**
  - **Callbacks, Promises, and async/await**
- Completely offline, ~5KB, and built for modern browser environments.
- Designed to simplify IndexedDB’s powerful storage model without sacrificing flexibility.

> 🧩 Ideal for apps that outgrow `localStorage` but want simplicity without a full library.

## 🧭 My Approach

I aim to build software that’s **easy to use**, even when the logic underneath is complex. I create **outside-the-box solutions** that are practical, minimal, and easy to understand.

> Many problems don’t need complex abstractions — just the **right idea matched with the right structure**.

I value correctness, clarity, and depth over frameworks and trends — and I'm most interested in projects where **technical thinking meets real user benefit**.
