# 👋 Hi, I'm Chung Lim Lee

I'm a Systems Software Engineer who builds technically deep, secure, and performance-focused applications.  
I care about how things actually work — from memory efficiency to input latency to browser quirks — and I build from scratch when existing tools don’t cut it.

I am the founder and maintainer of **Savvy Open** (savvyopen.com).

### [SO ChatX](https://github.com/ChungLimLee/SoChatX)

A privacy-first real-time chat system built from scratch using vanilla web technologies. Designed for self-hosted deployments, strong security, and efficient real-time communication.

### **Highlights**

* Secure login with MFA
* Real-time messaging
* 1:1 and group chat support
* Efficent history management
* Robust session control
* Optimized for low-resource hosting

## 🚀 [SO Gloper](https://github.com/ChungLimLee/so-gloper-react)

A **unified React library** for state, logic, and dataflow — all in one, with minimal boilerplate.

**Why it’s unique:**

* **Dual Modes:** Relax (simple) & Control (advanced, IDE-friendly)
* **Dynamic State Creation:** `createGloper` for programmatic, flexible state
* **Uniform Namespaces** with conflict detection
* **Built-in Persistence:** IndexedDB & LocalStorage
* **Lazy Loading:** initialize heavy states only on first use
* **Auto Immutable Updates** & React 18+ concurrency support

Build scalable, maintainable React apps faster — without juggling multiple libraries.

### 🎮 [SO Othello – Unlimited Endgame Generator/Solver](https://github.com/ChungLimLee/soOthello)
A fully interactive Othello app in JS with unlimited endgame generator/solver, study mode, puzzle sharing via link, and AI-powered interactive play.

- Generates **solvable endgame puzzles** from any board with 12 or more empty squares.
- Three versions of board representations:
  - A currently published version uses **1D-array** with unique optimized move generations.
  - A custom **bitboard** implementation enables compact binary operations, achieving up to **10× faster performance** than the 1D array.
  - A novel, self-developed **SO-board** that **outperforms** bitboards in certain metrics and shows potential for even greater overall speed.
- Allows **puzzle sharing via link** to LinkedIn, X (Twitter), WhatsApp, and Facebook — so users can easily share, discuss, and revisit specific puzzle states.
- Supports **undo/redo**, win/draw/loss outcome classification, and best-move exploration.
- Self-published and accepted by [https://worldothello.org.](https://www.worldothello.org/news/435/open-book-of-othello)

> ⚙️ Not just a game — a tool for strategy study and perfect-play exploration.

### 🗄️ [soStorage.js – LocalStorage-Like API Using IndexedDB](https://github.com/ChungLimLee/soStorage.js)
A tiny, zero-dependency JavaScript library that provides a **localStorage-like API**, backed by **IndexedDB** for modern browser storage.

- Use it just like `localStorage`, but with full support for:
  - **Structured data types** (objects, arrays, numbers, etc.)
  - **Larger data sizes**
  - **Callbacks, Promises, and async/await**
- Completely offline, ~5KB, and built for modern browser environments.
- Designed to simplify IndexedDB’s powerful storage model without sacrificing flexibility.

> 🧩 Ideal for apps that outgrow `localStorage` but want simplicity without a full library.

## 🧭 My Approach

I aim to build software that’s **easy to use**, even when the logic underneath is complex. I create **outside-the-box solutions** that are practical, minimal, and easy to understand.

> Many problems don’t need complex abstractions — just the **right idea matched with the right structure**.

I value correctness, clarity, and depth over frameworks and trends — and I'm most interested in projects where **technical thinking meets real user benefit**.
